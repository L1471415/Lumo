Important tips:

If you wish to spit out audio through a speaker make sure you use port 26.
The server uses TCP server architecture. This is the server when sending data make sure your the client.
The audio data needs to be in uint_8, but if you send the data as uint_16 or char then converting it to uint_8 is not too difficult (although for uint_16 you will need to do a bit more work).
